# European Soccer Data Analysis

In this project, I focus on team goals and how their attributes contributed to these goals.

1. Which Teams won the most matches?
2. What team attributes contribute to the most wins?


I use the Kaggle "European Soccer Database" which can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer.
The "European Soccer Database" consists on 7 tables: 

* Country
* League
* Match
* Player
* Player_Attributes
* Team
* Team_Attributes
